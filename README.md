<h3>Description</h3>
This is the Library project that I am making as part of the The Odin Project Curriculum.
This project will test and solidify my knowledge about objects and object constructors and prototypal inheritance, as well as teach me about CRUD functionality.
Also, this project is also the first project in the section of working with design patterns so it will force me to write cleaner, more readable code.
Moreover, project is made using HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS, as well as the Web Storage API that allows for some data storage on the user device.

<h3> Features </h3>

- Clean Code

- Classes and Objects

- Responsive web design

The project utilizes CRUD functionallity to offer the user four different features:

1. Creating a book
2. Reading created books
3. Updating saved books
4. Deleting saved books
