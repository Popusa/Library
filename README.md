Hello! This is a small-scale Library Management System that I am building as part of The Odin Project's Full Stack Javascript curriculum! 

This project will test and solidify my knowledge about objects and object constructors and prototypal inheritance!

This project is also the first project in the section of working with design patterns so it will force me to write cleaner, more readable code.

Link for the live version of the project will be here when I finish making it.
